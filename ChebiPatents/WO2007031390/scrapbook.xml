Furthermore, at higher pH values degradation of the <ne type="LIGAND" id="WO2007031390.HC.ligand-names.3" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:LIGAND:438" name="benzyloxypropionic" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:778508" relevant="false">benzyloxypropionic</ne> moiety can occur.
By varying the pH conditions, therefore, considerable amounts of by-products may be obtained during the course of the reaction, thus leading to a remarkable decrease in terms of yields of the process and degree of purity of the final compound (I).
Hence, because of the sensitivity of the reaction to pH values, the above carboxymethylation step of WO 00/02847 is carried out by properly dosing the addition of both reactants, that is of <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007031390.HC.chemical-names.13" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:COMPOUND:1572" name="bromoacetic acid" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:429355" relevant="true">bromoacetic acid</ne> and of the base, so as to get and maintain the desired basic pH values during the whole course of the reaction.
Typically, on an industrial scale, means are known to suitably dose reactants affecting the pH reaction environment such as, for instance, the use of pHmeters. With the aim of avoiding the formation of the aforementioned byproducts, therefore, pHmeters could be used to control and drive the addition of <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007031390.HC.chemical-names.14" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:COMPOUND:1572" name="bromoacetic acid" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:429355" relevant="true">bromoacetic acid</ne> and of the base in the above carboxymethylation reaction.
However, as minor variations of pH might lead to the preparation of the final compound in lower yields, because of the formation of relevant amounts of by-products and impurities, any inaccurate electrode pH measurement, whenever used to control the addition of the above reactants, would certainly represent a remarkable drawback and limitation. In this respect, it would be of utmost importance the need for pH electrodes which provide affordable pH measurements during the whole course of the reaction, under the above operative conditions of temperature and alkalinity.
The above requirement for an accurate and reliable pH measurement of the reaction medium could be even more important in the case of large amounts of <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007031390.HC.chemical-names.79" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:7085" name="sodium" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:26708" relevant="false">sodium</ne> ions, for instance due to the use of <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007031390.HC.chemical-names.27" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:7174" name="sodium hydroxide" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:32145" relevant="false">sodium hydroxide</ne>, which presence is known to interfere with pH electrode measurement.
Summary of the invention According to the present invention, it has now been found an improved process for the preparation of <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007031390.HC.chemical-names.66" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:COMPOUND:1580" name="BOPTA" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:698295" relevant="false">BOPTA</ne> of formula (I) comprising the carboxymethylation step of the above intermediate of formula (II), without the need of monitoring the pH of the reaction medium and thus dosing the addition of the reactants, up to the completion of the reaction.

The process of the invention is particularly advantageous for the industrial scale as any of the steps is carried out through a rather simplified and standardized procedure.

Importantly, the present process allows to obtain the chelating compound of formula (I) in particularly high yields and, also, with a high degree of purity.

From the above, it is clear to the skilled person that the concentration of the starting material of formula (II), as well as of any other reactant, is of utmost importance during the scaling up of the present process as it is strictly related to the dimensionability of the plant and, hence, its productivity.
The molar ratio between the compounds of formula (III) and (II), according to the present process, is of at least 4 moles of <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.29" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:868" name="alkylating compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:683438" relevant="false">alkylating compound</ne> (III) per mole of substrate
(II). Preferably, the said molar ratio (III) : (II) is comprised between 4 : 1 to 10 : 1 and, even more preferably, between 7 : 1 to 9 : 1.
The amount of base being used in the carboxymethylation reaction is related to the stoichiometry of the reaction and, in particular, to the quantity of <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.31" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:869" name="alkylating agent" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:515714" relevant="false">alkylating agent</ne> of formula (III) being used. Based on the substrate of formula (II), the said molar ratio may range from about 8 to about 20 moles of base per mole of compound (II).
The process of the invention is characterized by two distinct steps (a) and (b), carried out consecutively. The first one comprises adding the compound of formula (III) and the base to an aqueous solution of the compound of formula (II), at a temperature ranging from about 10&lt;0&gt;C to about 30&lt;0&gt;C. The said additions of reactants, in step (a), may comprise a given aliquot or aliquots of compound of formula (III) and a given aliquot or aliquots of base, that can be either added simultaneously, consecutively or alternately, in any order. Just as an example, if a single aliquot of compound of formula (III) and a single aliquot of base have been added to the aqueous solution of the starting material (II), in step (a), both reactants may be added simultaneously or consecutively in any order, that is compound of formula (III) followed by the base or vice versa.
For ease of reference, such a schedule of addition of both reactants, in step (a), may be represented as follows:
A and B simultaneously; or
A followed by B, or B followed by A, wherein, unless otherwise provided, A stands for the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.32" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:869" name="alkylating agent" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:515714" relevant="false">alkylating agent</ne> of formula (III) and B stands for the base.
According to an additional example, the compound of formula (III) and the base may be added to the starting material of formula (II), in step (a), through a plurality of additions either occurring simultaneously, consecutively or through an alternate pathway, in any order. In particular, for instance in the case of four aliquots of the compound of formula (III) and of four aliquots of base to be added, in step (a), any of the schedules below may be followed:
</snippet></P>

<P><snippet XPoint="/1/2/2/9" id="s5">4 x A and 4 x B simultaneously; or
</snippet></P>

<P><snippet XPoint="/1/2/2/11" id="s6">4 x A followed by 4 x B, or even 4 x B followed by 4 x A; or - A alternated by B or B alternated by A, each couple of additions being repeated four times, that is 4 x (AB) or 4 x (BA), respectively.
Preferably, both reactants of the present process are added, in step (a), through a plurality of additions occurring in an alternate way. Even more preferably, the said additions may comprise from 3 to 8 aliquots of both compound (III) and of base, added in an alternate way [e.g. from 3 x (AB) to 8 x (AB) or from 3 x (BA) to 8 x (BA)]. As set forth in the experimental section, possible variations in the schedule of addition of both reactants may also occur including, for instance, an initial alternate addition or additions of A and B followed by a subsequent alternate addition or additions of these same reactants in the reversed order, that is of B and A.
Substantially analogous considerations may apply to step (b), only in the case an additional amount of <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.33" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:869" name="alkylating agent" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:515714" relevant="false">alkylating agent</ne> of formula (III) and of base have to be added to the reaction mixture being obtained from step (a).
Preferably, however, step (b) also comprises that both reactants (III) and the base are added to the reaction mixture as per the above step (a).
Also in this case, both reactants may be either added simultaneously, consecutively or through an alternate way of addition, in any order.
However, whilst the addition of the reactants in step (a) and up to the completion of step (a) itself occurs at a temperature ranging from about 10&lt;0&gt;C to about 30&lt;0&gt;C, step (b) is carried out, during the optional addition of the reactants, and anyway up to completion of the carboxymethylation reaction, at a temperature ranging from about 30&lt;0&gt;C to about 60&lt;0&gt;C. To this extent, as set forth in the experimental section, the order of the addition of the reactants in step (b), whenever occurring, is independently selected from the order of the addition of the reactants in the previous step (a).
Hence, if step (a) is for instance carried out by adding 5 aliquots of compound (III) and 5 aliquots of base in an alternate way, e.g. as 5 x (AB), the optional addition of reactants in step (b), for instance of 3 aliquots of compound (III) and of base in an alternate way, may occur as follows: 3 x (AB) or 3 x (BA).
According to additional preferred embodiments of the invention, step (a) may be carried out at room temperature, that is at a temperature ranging from about 20&lt;0&gt;C to about 25[deg.]C, and step (b) may be carried out at a temperature ranging from about 50&lt;0&gt;C to about 55[deg.]C, whether or not comprising any addition of the compound of formula (III) and of the base. Even more preferably, the whole process is performed by operating at temperatures ranging from about 20&lt;0&gt;C to about 25[deg.]C, in step (a), and from about 50&lt;0&gt;C to about 55[deg.]C in step (b).
According to this latter embodiment of the invention, therefore, at the end of the additions of the reactants, in step (a), the reaction medium is warmed up to the temperature of step (b).
From all of the above, it is clear to the skilled person that according to the selected schedule of addition of the reactants in both steps (a) and (b), the total amount of compound of formula (III) and of base to be added may be partitioned among the single additions occurring in any of the steps.
Preferably, though not necessarily, the total amount of compound of formula (III) and of base to be used in the present process is equally partitioned among the single aliquots to be added.
Besides being highly reproducible, the present process is further characterized by a high robustness as possible variations in the time of the addition of the reactants, in any of the steps (a) and (b), do not affect to a significant extent the present process. Hence, as the carboxymethylation reaction the present process refers to may be completed in a time period suitable for the industrial scale, for instance in a few hours and preferably within 12 hours, it should be clear to the skilled person that the time occurring for the addition of the aliquots of reactant, of any possible pause between the additions themselves and up to completion of the reaction, should be scheduled accordingly. Typically, on an industrial scale, each addition of reactant is carried out in a time ranging from about one minute to about 60 minutes. Likewise, depending on the number of aliquots of reactants to be added, the time spent between additions - formerly referred to as pause - ma be null or even up to about 45 minutes. Analogous considerations may also apply to a possible pause occurring between steps (a) and (b), during which time the reaction medium is warmed up to the temperature of step (b), for instance in about 10 to about 30 minutes. In this respect it is worth noting that the optional addition of the reactants, in step (b), may either start at the time of heating of the reaction mixture, that is just after completion of step (a), or even subsequently, that is after any suitable time period [e.g. possible pause between the last addition of one of the reactants in step (a) and the first optional addition of one of the reactants, in step (b)].
For a general reference to the operative conditions being adopted in the present process, together with details thereof, see the experimental section.
At the completion of the carboxymethylation reaction the mixture is worked up according to conventional methods, for instance as reported in WO 00/02847. Typically, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature (that is from about 20&lt;0&gt;C to about 25[deg.]C) and pH is adjusted to about 5 by addition of <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007031390.HC.chemical-names.102" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:COMPOUND:395" name="hydrochloric acid" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:17883" relevant="false">hydrochloric acid</ne>, for instance of a 34% w/w aqueous solution, so as to give an aqueous solution containing the compound of formula (I).
The subsequent purification and recovery of (I) is carried out as reported in WO 00/02847, substantially as follows: a) percolation and elution on a chromatographic resin; b) concentration and desalting by nano filtration; c) acidification and subsequent crystallization of (I).
The final compound (I) being obtained according to the present process, in its crystalline form, is characterised by a high quality profile and manageability as it is easily centrifugated and dried.
As set forth in the experimental section, several trials have been carried out according to the present process so as to prepare the compound of formula (I).
As reported therein, all of the obtained data clearly support the consistency and reliability of the method despite any of the several variations affecting, for instance, the modality of addition of the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.34" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:869" name="alkylating agent" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:515714" relevant="false">alkylating agent</ne> and of the base, the amount of the reactants themselves, the range of temperature in steps (a) and (b) and, also, the time of addition of the reactants. In all of the cases, the compound of formula (I) was obtained in particularly high yields, being calculated from the starting material of formula (II). In addition, this same compound (I) was constantly characterized by a high degree of purity, as per the HPLC data [see % area of (I)] being obtained according to conventional methods. Unexpectedly, both yields and purity of the compound of formula (I) as obtained according to the present process resulted significantly superior than those obtained in example 1, purposely reported as a comparative example.
According to example 1, in fact, the compound of formula (I) was prepared by first heating the aqueous solution of the starting material (II) at 55[deg.]C, by slowly adding the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.35" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:869" name="alkylating agent" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:515714" relevant="false">alkylating agent</ne> and by suitably dosing the base, so as to keep the desired pH values.
Hence, besides the fact that the process of the invention allows to operate on an industrial scale without the need of monitoring the pH of the reaction mixture during the addition of the reactants and the whole course of the reaction, it also provides a remarkable improvement in the synthesis of the intermediate compound of formula (I), to be used in the field of diagnostics.
In addition to all of the above, the present process may also find useful and advantageous applications for any carboxymethylation step occurring on a suitable primary and secondary <ne id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.14" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:493" name="amine" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:32952" relevant="false" type="CLASS">amine</ne>.

The data reported in table I clearly support any of the aforementioned advantages of the present process and, also, the robustness of the method itself together with its reproducibility and reliability upon variations of the adopted operative conditions. In particular, trial (1) corresponds to previous example 2, which unexpected results in terms of yield and purity of (I) over known prior art methods have been already reported.
Moreover, the possibility of varying the time of addition of the reactants, the sequence and modality of the additions themselves and, also, the possibility of varying to a rather great extent the amount of reactants to be added, despite the sensitivity of the reaction itself to possible pH variations, is certainly to be regarded as unexpectedly advantageous.
This latter aspect is further supported by a comparison between trials 1 and 3, both leading to comparable results in terms of (I) despite the fact that the total amount of base is as twice the total amount of <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.36" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:869" name="alkylating agent" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:515714" relevant="false">alkylating agent</ne> in trial 1 and the corresponding total amount of base exceeds to a rather great extent (by B") twice the total amount of <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007031390.HC.class-names.37" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:869" name="alkylating agent" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007031390:515714" relevant="false">alkylating agent</ne> in trial 3.
