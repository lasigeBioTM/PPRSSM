TECHNICAL FIELD
The present application is related to the treatment of inflammation, and especially chronic intestinal inflammation. The present application more particularly relates to a non-toxic oral and topical formulation that includes a pharmaceutically effective amount of dairy proteins and its use in the treatment of inflammation.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Sumerian and antic Egyptian cultures described inflammatory processes as abscesses and ulcers. Greek culture introduced the term edema and the vocabulary of inflammation began its development. The first comprehensive description of inflammatory symptoms can be found in the writing of Aulus Celsus (died AD 38). He introduced the cardinal symptoms of inflammation: redness, swelling, heat and pain.
Inflammation is usually a local protective reaction that serves to protect the organism against infections or trauma. Excessive inflammation or unusual inactivity of an otherwise normal inflammatory process leads to inflammatory diseases.
Inflammatory processes are a combination of very complex mechanisms in which many factors are implicated. These factors are cellular (endothelial cells, macrophages, leucocytes, etc) and/or humoral (coagulation factors, <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.35" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:905" name="Cytokines" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:496537" relevant="false" type="CLASS">cytokines</ne>, <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.1" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:104" name="eicosanoid acids" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:190808" relevant="false" type="CLASS">eicosanoid acids</ne>, adhesion molecules, free radicals, etc). In general, inflammatory processes are associated with immune cell proliferation, infiltration of cells and accumulation of exudates at the inflammation site, and degradation of the injured tissue. Liberation of mediators like <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.36" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:905" name="Cytokines" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:496537" relevant="false" type="CLASS">cytokines</ne> and <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.2" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:104" name="eicosanoid acids" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:190808" relevant="false" type="CLASS">eicosanoid acids</ne> lead to a more global reaction like fever.

NF-[kappa]B is also known to regulate the expression of a variety of proteins involved in the various cellular responses such as apoptosis, immune responses, and inflammatory reactions.
In abnormal inflammation processes, the inflammatory process remains out of control and induces persistent diseases. Many diseases are described with an important inflammatory component, but chronic inflammatory diseases are recognized to be polysystemic diseases with an unknown origin. They are as diversified as psoriasis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis. In general, an immune component in all of these diseases can be seen.
The description of Crohn's disease made hereafter should be viewed only as an illustration of the topic and will not represent a limit to the possible applications of this application.
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes persistent or recurring inflammation of one or more parts of the intestine. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal system, from the mouth to the anus. There is no known cure for Crohn's disease. The causes are unknown and are not only due to stress as was once thought. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can occur at any age, but usually begins in the late teens or early adulthood. It is sometimes associated with medical problems outside of the intestine, including arthritis, cancer, gallstones, kidney stones, and skin conditions. Crohn's disease symptoms include abdominal pains, diarrhea, and weight loss. Pain is most often felt around the navel or the lower right part of the abdomen. The pains may occur during eating or soon after a meal. Steady dull aches of the abdomen may also be felt and may be worsen with activities like jogging and sports. Other Crohn's disease symptoms that patients have noted are fatigue and loss of appetite.

Infliximad is a recently approved drug for treating Crohn's disease patients. The purpose of infliximad is to prevent inflammation by inhibiting the activity of TNF.
One important medical need is the effective treatment of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. These diseases are treated with drugs that have high side effects profiles and limited efficacy. Currently, the commonly used therapeutic alternatives available to treat chronic inflammations consist in the use of <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.18" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:20" name="Corticosteroids" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:36699" relevant="false">corticosteroids</ne> or <ne type="ONT">NSAIDs</ne>.
Unfortunately, all of these <ne type="ONT">anti-inflammatory agents</ne> are associated with highly significant side effects, including gastrointestinal irritations and bleeding, bone loss, and fluid retention, some of which can reduce significantly the well being of the patients.
Several drugs have been designed to treat inflammatory diseases by targeting specific cells, specific <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.37" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:905" name="Cytokines" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:496537" relevant="false" type="CLASS">cytokines</ne>, or specific interactions between ligands and receptors.

TGF-[beta]s are homodimeric proteins of about 25 kDa comprising identical 12.5 kDa polypeptide chains linked through <ne type="LIGAND" id="WO2007038870.HC.ligand-names.1" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:LIGAND:619" name="disulphide" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:629950" relevant="false">disulphide</ne> bridges. They may form latent complexes with other proteins, and these complexes may be activated by acid treatment or mild proteolysis
(Roberts, A. B. et al., Supra). They are multipotent, having a number of biological activities dependant upon the type of target cell, the state of differentiation of the cell and the presence of other factors. Their effects include stimulation or inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, regulation of extracellular matrix deposition, immunomodulation, steroidogenesis and angiogenesis (Roberts, A. B. et al., Supra).
Suitable methods are known for purifying TGF-[beta]s from various species such as human, mouse, green monkey, pig, bovine, and chick, and from various cellular sources such as bone cells, platelets, or placental cells, as well as for producing it in recombinant cell cultures and for determining their activities (European Patents 200,341; 169,016; 268,561 and 267,463; G.B. Patent. Application 2,146,335; U.S. Patent 4,774,322).
TGF-[beta] is multifunctional, as it can either stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation, differentiation, and other critical processes in cell functions (M. Sporn, Science, 233:532-534 (1986)). TGF-[beta] has been shown to have numerous regulatory actions on a wide variety of cells. Recent studies indicate an important role for TGF-[beta] in immune cells (J. Kehrl et al., J. Exp. Med., 163: 1037-1050 (1986); H-J. Ristow, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 83: 5531-5533 (1986); A. Rook et al., J. Immunol., 136: 3916-3920 (1986)) and in proliferation of connective and soft tissues for wound healing applications (U.S. Pat. No. 4,774,228).
Moreover, TGF-[beta] has been described as a suppressor of <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.38" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:905" name="Cytokines" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:496537" relevant="false" type="CLASS">cytokines</ne> production (interferon-[gamma] (IFN-[gamma]), TGF-[beta]), indicating a possible use as an <ne type="ONT">immunosuppressant</ne> for treating inflammatory disorders (European Patent 269,408; U.S. Patent 4,806,523). Further, TGF-[beta] induces collagen secretion in human fibroblast cultures (Roberts et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 4167-4171 (1986)), stimulates the release of PGs and mobilization of <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007038870.HC.chemical-names.36" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:7090" name="calcium" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:22984" relevant="false">calcium</ne> (A. Tashjian et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 82: 4535-4538 (1985)) and inhibits endothelial regeneration (R. Heimarket al., Science, 233: 1078-1080 (1986)).
TGF-[beta] is produced by both immune and non-immune cells, and it exhibits a broad range of functions, including the modulation of immune responses. Oral administration of TGF-[beta]2 is well known to decrease the inflammatory process.
For example, Fell et al. {Aliment Pharmacol. Then 14 (3): 281-289, (2000)) have demonstrated the antiinflammatory effect of a rich polymeric TGF-[beta]2 diet (CT3211 : Nestle Vevey, Switzerland) in children with IBD. In this study, 29 children with IBD were treated with CT3211 during 8 weeks. Following the treatment, the results shown that 79% of the children were in complete remission from their disease. The macroscopic and histological healing of the ileum and colon was associated with a decrease of proinflammatory <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.39" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:905" name="Cytokines" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:496537" relevant="false" type="CLASS">cytokines</ne> mRNA (IL-1[beta], IFN-[gamma], IL-8) in ileum and colonic mucosa as well as an increased TGF-[beta]2 mRNA in ileum tissue. This study confirms the interest in using TGF-[beta]2 solution as a therapeutic agent.
TGF-[beta]s, including TGF-[beta]2, have a number of immunoregulatory properties and act at several stages of the inflammatory and immune reactions. For example they inhibit the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes (Kerhl, J. H., et al. J. Immunol. 137: 3855-3860, (1986); Kerhl, J. H., et al. J. Exp. Med. 163: 1037-1050, (1986)). They also antagonize the effects of interleukins including IL-1 , IL-2 and IL-3 and other immunoregulatory agents such as TNF-[alpha] and interferons (Roberts, A. B. et al. , Supra). TGF-[beta]s interfere with certain accessory cell functions important in antigen presentation and they were specifically shown to suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-Class Il expression by melanomas, glial cells and astrocytes (Czamiecki, et al J. Immunol. 140: 4217-4223, (1988); Schlusener, J. Neuroimmunol. 24: 41-47, (1990); Zuber, et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 18 : 1623-1626, (1988)). The regulation of MHC-Class Il expression on epithelial cells in the intestine by TGF-[beta]s or MGF has been reported in European patent EP0527283.

In US patent 6,403,562, methods for treating autoimmune-related diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), are presented.

No. 5,952,295 gives a precise formulation of enteral preparation for the treatment of inflammatory conditions in the gastro-intestinal tract using a casein fraction with TGF-[beta]2 and reports improvement of such inflammatory conditions in an open-label study with 11 young patients. European Patent 0313515 describes a milk growth factor fraction obtained from milk, and the use of this fraction for treating trauma, suppressing the immune response or treating cancer in mammals. Patent application WO 02/05828 proposes the treatment of skin disorders by neutral or basic growth factors from milk or colostrum. Japanese Patent 14308090 describes a fraction from colostrum with TGF-[beta] activity.
A dairy growth factors fraction obtained from chromatographic methods, especially with an ionic exchange step, is described in US patent 6,447,808. This fraction can be used for the treatment of gastrointestinal injuries, ulcers, or surface wounds. Patent application WO 01/25276 also describes isolation of growth factors from dairy products by the use of chromatography. Different fractions can be produced by this process, especially fractions enriched in TGF-[beta] and IGF-1.
Patent application WO 03/006500 describes a process to obtain a dairy fraction enriched in TGF-[beta]. This process is based on a precipitation step induced by a thermal treatment in acidic conditions followed by the recovery of the precipitate by filtration. The fraction contains 45 to 80% of alpha-lactalbumin protein and more than 5 [mu]g of TGF-[beta] per gram of proteins. This fraction is proposed for the treatment of auto-immune diseases, arthritis, osteoporosis, wound healing and graft rejection.
Considering the state of the art described above, all of the methods of the prior art are complex, expensive and time consuming. Thus, there is still a significant need for a new and simple method for obtaining a dairy fraction enriched in TGF-[beta] that can be used effectively in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders (such as chronic intestinal disorders) without the disadvantages associated with the currently available treatments. Products containing growth factors, especially TGF-[beta]2, present a very interesting approach to the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorder, and especially of Crohn's disease.

In accordance with the present application, there is provided a composition and a method for treating chronic inflammatory diseases in an individual, wherein the composition effective in stimulating a specific immunological response against a physiological imbalance aberrantly expressed in inflamed tissues.
This composition comprises a cocktail of products that shares growth and regeneration characteristics of a growth factor that is aberrantly expressed in inflamed tissues (such as human inflamed tissues). Particular growth factors included in the composition of the present application are, but not limited to, TGFs, such as TGF-[beta]1 and TGF-[beta]2, beta- lactoglobulin and at least 15% of dairy derived proteins. The growth factors present in the composition are distinguished by having a strong anti-inflammatory action. The concentration of the compounds in the composition of the present application may be adjusted depending of the needs. TGF-[beta]1 can be present at concentration of between 0.1 to 5 [mu]g/g of composition and TGF-[beta]2 can be present at concentration of between 5 and 50 [mu]g/g of composition. Preferably, TGF-[beta]1 is present at concentration of 0.2 to 1.2 [mu]g/g, and TGF-[beta]2 at between 10 to 18 [mu]g/g of composition. The preparation can be used daily in a customary manner.
In another embodiment of the present application, the composition comprises at least 70% (w/w) of whey derived proteins. The total concentration of proteins in the composition would normally be of at least 80%. Fat concentration can be generally found at concentration between about 0.5 to 10 % (w/w) in the composition.
In one particular embodiment of the present application, at least 35%, preferably 70%, of the proteins are <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007038870.HC.chemical-names.95" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:5421" name="water" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:15377" relevant="false">water</ne>-soluble. The proteins may be comprised of at least 60% (w/w) of [beta]-lactoglobulin, and/or between 0.1 to 30% (w/w) of lactoferrin.
The active compounds according to the application, such as the growth factors mentioned earlier, can be mixed with customary pharmaceutically tolerable diluents or vehicles and, if appropriate, with other auxiliaries molecules, and administered, for example, topically, orally, parenterally or colorectally. This formulation can preferably be administered orally in the form of granules, capsules, pills, tablets, film-coated tablets, sugar-coated tablets, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, dispersions, aerosols, solutions, and/or liquids. It can also be administered as suppositories, vaginal suppositories, and/or parenterally, e.g. in the form of solutions, emulsions, creams or suspensions.

Estimates of the prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases vary according to each specific disease. For example, intestinal inflammatory diseases are considered to affect 0.3% of American population. In all types of chronic inflammatory diseases, the composition can be used prophylatically and for the treatment of the disorders.
While a detectable immune or tissue response is likely to be beneficial, efficacy can also be deduced by an improvement in symptoms, or control of the chronic inflammatory condition beyond what would be expected without treatment.
For prophylaxis, the composition is administered in order to decrease manifestations of the disease in frequency and strength. Treatment in the manifest stage leads to its curtailment and to the alleviation of the symptoms.
The composition can also be administered colorectally or protected with enteric coating for delivery in the intestinal part of digestive tractus. The composition can also be incorporated into customary oral or pharmaceutical bases for preferred oral administrations.
The application also relates to the use of the composition according to the application for the production of a pharmaceutical composition, in particular oral and pharmaceutical compositions for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.
Without wishing to be bound to theory, the composition also addresses the underlying T-cell disorder that results in an inflammatory condition. The Applicants have recognized that most, if not all, of the current therapies in the prior art for T-cell mediated inflammatory conditions are designed to eliminate T-cells and to thereby improve the inflammation condition. A major problem with those treatments is that there is a possibility that the therapy itself is so toxic that it may promote recurrence during healing. The toxicity of these treatments can unleash some or all of the <ne id="WO2007038870.HC.class-names.41" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:905" name="Cytokines" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007038870:496537" relevant="false" type="CLASS">cytokines</ne> that are associated with the promulgation of these chronic and often rebounding diseases.
The synergy of the two TGF-[beta] factors of the composition results in a non-toxic, highly effective treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases that is without the side effects observed with virtually all other therapies for those diseases.
The present application will be more readily understood by referring to the following examples which are given to illustrate the application rather than to limit its scope. EXAMPLE 1 : Preparation of composition

TGF-[beta] has multiple immunosuppressive effects at the cellular level and has been described as inhibiting type 1 and type 2 cells, B cells, CD8&lt;+&gt; T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. TGF-[beta] blocks cell-cycle progression and may have a direct effect on expression of the gene encoding IL-2 (Brabletz et al., MoI. CeI. Biol., 13(2): 1155-1162, 1993). Importantly, it can suppress the expression of IL-12 and IL-2 receptors, as well as downregulate MHC class Il expression on macrophages (specifically by antagonizing TNF-[alpha] and IFN-[gamma]) (Harber et al., Exp. Rev. MoI. Med., 27 Nov., http://www-ermm.cbcu.cam.ac.uk/00002143h.htm, 2000). The importance of TGF-[beta] in the induction and maintenance of normal tolerance has been illustrated by TGF-[beta]- knockout mice, who incur severe, spontaneous, multi-organ, autoimmune disease associated with autoantibody production, which proves fatal in early life (Harber et al., Exp. Rev. MoI. Med., 27 Nov., http://www-ermm.cbcu.cam.ac.uk/00002143h.htm, 2000). T lymphocytes isolated from murine spleen (splenocytes) are immune cells that respond to ConA (mitogenic stress) by proliferation and cytokine production (Mercier, et al. Internal Dairy J., 14: 175-183, (2004); Wong, et al. J. Dairy ScL, 81: 1825-1832, (1998)).

The composition produced in example 1 and described in example 2 (1, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 [mu]g of the total composition per ml of culture medium), was added to the cells for the whole incubation period and dose-dependently decreased 1) the lymphocyte proliferation (Fig. 1), 2) the production of IL-2 (Fig. 2), and 3) the production of IFN-[gamma] (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 1, there was a significant inhibition (Sl) of induced proliferation by the composition. Without wishing to be bound to theory, these results suggest that the composition presents immunomodulatory functions and that it can be use to address immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases and related arthropathies.

EXAMPLE 5 : HLA-B27 rats
HLA-B27 transgenic rat, expressing HLA-B27 and human [beta]2m, exhibits a phenotype similar to humans suffering B27 related rheumatic disorders such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. This rat model is useful for research and pharmacological studies of spontaneous systemic inflammation, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and skin diseases including psoriasis and alopecia.
The primary goal of this example was to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the composition produced in example 1 and described in example 2 in IBD present in HLA-B27 rat model. Basically, four group of ten (10) male HLA-B27 transgenic rats (7 to 20 weeks old) were formed following randomization which was be based on the week of first symptoms of IBD (i.e. positive Hemoccult(TM)). After one week of adaptation, the composition produced in example 1 and described in example 2 (7.82, 78.2 and 782 mg/kg) was orally administered daily via a gastric needle (total volume of 1 ,5 ml).
Hematocrits. As shown is Fig. 8, hematocrit levels were higher in rats treated with 7,82 and 78,2 mg/kg of the composition produced in example 1 and described in example 2 compared to the value observed before the beginning of the treatment. Also, animals treated with 7,82 and 78,2 mg/kg of the composition produced in example 1 and described in example 2 had a higher level of hematocrit compared to placebo (PBS). Hemoglobin. During the course of the disease, hemoglobin levels decreased significantly in all groups. However, the decrease was significantly lower in rats treated with 7,82 and 78,2 mg/kg of the composition produced in example 1 and described in example 2 compared to placebo or even to 782 mg/kg of the composition produced in example 1 and described in example 2 (Fig. 9).
